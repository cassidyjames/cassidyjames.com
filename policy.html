                    <h1>Dan on Public Policy</h1>
                    <p>I am not a lawyer, politician, scientist, economist, or civil engineer; I'm just a software developer. When I approach public policy issues, I do it from a design perspective. It's my belief that we can only solve our biggest problems by identifying and adressing their root causes. I've chosen to highlight some of the things below as what I believe to be big solutions for many of the problems we face in the US today.</p>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="grid">
                <div class="half">
                    <p data-align="center"><i class="fa fa-4x fa-lightbulb-o"></i></p>
                    <h2 data-align="center">Clean, Cheap Energy</h2>
                    <div class="revealer">
                        <p>The price of energy affects the price of everything. When gas prices go up, so do bread prices. Entangling energy and foreign policy allows the US economy to be held hostage by outside interests. Domestic energy eliminates the need to pursue foreign conflicts in order to secure energy prices. </p>
                        <p>Energy production needs to be clean, not just for the air we breath but also for the water we drink. Recent disasters in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis">Flint, Michigan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliso_Canyon_gas_leak">Los Angeles, California</a> only serve to highlight that our current means of energy production are unsafe and cause tangible public harm in addition to contributing to adverse climate change.</p>
                        <p>A transition from fossil fuels is necessary to combat the largest global security issue of our time: climate change. The adverse effects of climate change have already <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/23/martin-omalley/fact-checking-link-between-climate-change-and-isis">lead to civil unrest</a> in the Middle East. If we do nothing by 2100, <a href="http://phys.org/news/2015-10-sea-swallow-miami-orleans.html">Over 1 Million</a> US citizens could be forced to relocate due to rising sea levels.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="half">
                    <p data-align="center"><i class="fa fa-4x fa-usd"></i></p>
                    <h2 data-align="center">Universal Basic Income</h2>
                    <div class="revealer">
                        <p>Current state assistance programs that rely on means testing create a situation where finding work may result in a net loss of income. Means testing also implies overhead to determine eligibility. This means that people participating in these programs are disincentivized to find work and we pay extra to keep it that way.</p>
                        <p>Economists say that raising the minimum wage <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/06/ben-cardin/does-raising-minimum-wage-result-job-growth/">is either harmful or has no effect</a>. UBI would allow us to abolish the minimum wage, creating a free-er market by lowering costs of production. </p>
                        <p>UBI disincentivizes wasteful government spending and inefficient union practices. Creating more "jobs" is no longer a concern; doing real meaningful work as efficiently as possible is.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">Job automation is inevitable</a>, but more than that job automation is good for society. We should strive for a future where people are no longer forced to find work in order to survive. UBI allows for an economy where the elimination of jobs doesn't mean starvation and homelessness.</p>
