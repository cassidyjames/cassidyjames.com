                <h2>The 2016 Election</h2>
                <p>This election, I'm endorsing <a href="https://go.berniesanders.com/page/content/contribute/">Bernie Sanders</a> for President of the United States. Bernie and I agree on things like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stopping domestic spying and ensuring the privacy of the American people.</li>
                    <li>Campaign finance reform and the abolition of gerrymandering to ensure fair elections.</li>
                    <li>Working to stop the looming threat of climate change, preserving the environment we depend on, and re-invigorating the American economy by focusing on a new clean energy infrastructure and stopping fracking and offshore drilling.</li>
                    <li>Securing health care and services for all Americans with a single payer healthcare system.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Even if you don't plan to vote this election, I strongly recommend that you visit iSideWith.com and take their political quiz before choosing a presidential candidate. iSideWith is designed to match you with a candidate based on what matters most: the issues. As far as I can tell, it is very unbiased (I've seen plenty of matches for both Republican and Democrat candidates).</p>

                <h2>on Public Policy</h2>
                <p>Manifesto goes here.</p>

                <h3>Clean, Cheap, Renewable Energy</h3>
                <p>Energy affects the price of everything. When gas prices go up, so do bread prices.</p>
                <p>A transition from fossil fuels is necessary to combat the largest global security issue of our time: climate change.</p>
                <p>Energy production should not be entangled with foreign policy. Domestic clean energy means less global conflict.</p>

                <h3>Universal Basic Income</h3>
                <p><a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=UBI means a smaller government that provides a springboard for finding meaningful employment &hashtags=BasicIncome" class="inline-tweet">UBI means a smaller government that provides a springboard for finding meaningful employment.</a></p>
                <p>Current state assistance programs that rely on means testing create a situation where finding work may result in a net loss of income. Not only that, but means testing implies overhead in these programs to determine eligibility. This means that people participating in these programs are disincentived to find work and we pay extra to keep it that way.</p>
                <p>Economists say that raising the minimum wage <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/06/ben-cardin/does-raising-minimum-wage-result-job-growth/">is either harmful or has no effect</a>. UBI would allow us to abolish the minimum wage, creating a free-er market by lowering costs of production. </p>
                <p>UBI disincentives wasteful government spending and inefficient union practices. Creating more "jobs" is no longer a concern; doing real meaningful work as efficiently as possible is.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">Job automation is inevitable</a>, but more than that job automation is good for society. We should strive for a future where people are no longer forced to find work in order to survive. UBI allows for an economy where the elimination of jobs doesn't mean starvation and homelessness.</p>

                <h3>Criminal Justice Reform</h3>
                <p>The current criminal justice system unfairly penalizes the poor. Individuals with criminal records have a difficult time re-integrating.</p>
                <p>In an ideal society we don't just punish criminals, we seek to remove the conditions that lead to crime.</p>
                <p>It should be easier to do the right thing than to do the wrong thing. If it's easier to succeed by harming others, something is broken</p>
